# Machine-Learning
This project employs a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to summarize data obtained from interview results. The chosen model for this project is Palm2 from Google Vertex AI. We have customized the input and output of the Palm2 model to meet the specific requirements of the project.

This approach enables the integration of advanced technology in the data analysis process, aiming to enhance efficiency and accuracy in summarizing interview information. Thus, the project combines the strengths of large language models to support data analysis tasks involving interviews.
